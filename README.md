# WDD-Portfolio4 - Board Debut
Board debut is a web application that allows the user to search up any board game, expansion, or add-ons for their favorite games in order to store them in their collection or to make a wishlist. Easily keep track of your collection of games so you don't have to remember every single one whenever you get asked "What games do you have?" Now, its as simple as opening up your collection page and letting them scroll through your own collection. Family or friends having troubles with gift ideas for you? Now, you can just share your wishlist with them so that they can easily find some interesting games to get you! Another plus, your wishlist will keep track of any price changes the games go through. With that, you can wait and see if that game you've been eying goes on sale anytime soon.
